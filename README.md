This is a little AVR ATmega8 toy that I build as a thank you gift for some very
nice people. All the firmware and code to generate the patterns is open source
under the GPL v3.

The 5x7 font file in the Python sources (CharDB.py) is ripped from a public
domain implementation that unfortunately I do not have the exact sources
anymore of. :-( So if you know where it's from, please do tell me and I will
give appropriate credit. I'm very sorry that I don't know where it's from (have
had this for almost 10 years on my hard disk somewhere).

Have fun!
Cheers,
Johannes
